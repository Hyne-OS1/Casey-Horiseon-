# Challenge-2

* https://hyne-os1.github.io/Challenge-2/

## Description

* The initial motivation for this project was to create a simple and easy to use website portfolio that will take you to each completed self project.

* The building of this project was to create a user frendly and straight forward website that gave external links to both a personal github aswell as a destination for a completed previous project each with their respective headings and information.

* Creating a straight-forward site allows users to simplistically navigate their way to each heading of content aswell as the inspect element providing a way  for users to interact and view how each piece of CSS/HTML is structured and composed for reference.

* Taking on this project had its challenging aspects of both css and HTML semantics but upon completion has gave me a much broader understanding of how to set up and structure my own code from scratch. Having this code will serve as a useful tool for future reference in any upcoming challenges.

## Usage

Using the portfolio Mock-up is quite easy and user friendly. Upon clicking any of the links at the top of your screen you will be directed to each corresponding section on the page. Each area has a section of information with hyperlink image resources and text that will take you to the destination of each completed piece of work.
